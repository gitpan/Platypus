Platypus is a web application framework built on top of Apache
and mod_perl. It's still in very early stages of development,
but even now it offers many more application facilities than
CGI or Apache::Registry.

The web site for Platypus is at:
  http://www.maz.org/platypus/

The standard goodies, like a mailing list and a bug database,
will be supplied if the market demands them.

Platypus is developed in the spirit of the Apache and mod_perl
projects. Find more information about them at:
  http://www.apache.org/httpd.html
  http://perl.apache.org/

If you're doing application development with mod_perl, consider
picking up Lincoln Stein and Doug MacEachern's book "Writing
Apache Modules with Perl and C". It's a fabulous resource:
  http://www.modperl.com/

I think that's it. Enjoy -
